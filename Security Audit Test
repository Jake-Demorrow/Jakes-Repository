Below is a Risk Assessment for a fake company used for an internal security audit practice which I performed.
You will find the following;
1. The scenario of the audit practice
2. A list of the fake companies’ assets along with their current risk score.
3. The companies’ current Scope and Goals of the Internal audit.
4. The companies’ control assessment from the audit.
5. The companies’ compliance assessment from the audit.


This scenario is based on a fictional company:
Fake Company is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. Their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 
The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   
The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture. The IT manager wants to use the audit findings as evidence to obtain approval to expand his department. 
The task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment. Then, perform an internal audit to complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist. 




Current assets;
Assets managed by the IT Department include:
●	On-premises equipment for in-office business needs.
●	Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.
●	Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory management.
●	Internet access.
●	Internal network.
●	Vendor access management.
●	Data center hosting services.
●	Data retention and storage.
●	Badge readers.
●	Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring.

Risk description;
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Fake Company does not have the proper controls in place and may not be compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards. 
Control best practices
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Fake Company will need to dedicate resources to managing assets. Additionally, they will need to determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

Risk score;
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to necessary compliance regulations and standards.
Additional comments
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium, because the IT department does not know which assets would be lost. The likelihood of a lost asset or fines from governing bodies is high because Fake Company does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not adhering to required regulations and standards related to keeping customer data private.

Scope;
Fake Company internal IT audit will assess the following:
●	Current user permissions set in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, security information and event management (SIEM) tool.
●	Current implemented controls in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
●	Current procedures and protocols set for the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewall, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
●	Ensure current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols in place align with necessary compliance requirements.
●	Ensure current technology is accounted for. Both hardware and system access.

Goal;
The goals for Fake Companies’ internal IT audit are:
●	To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) 
●	Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant 
●	Fortify system controls
●	Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential management 
●	Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks 
●	Ensure they are meeting compliance requirements 




Below is the companies control assessment following the audit. 
You will find;
1. A list of controls, their control type, and a description of the control. The Controls will be put into the categories of Administrative, Technical and, Physical.
2. Whether they need to be implemented, which will be marked by an "(X)".
