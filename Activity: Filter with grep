Scenario:
In this scenario, I need to obtain information contained in server log and user data files. I also need to find files with specific names.

Task 1. Search for error messages in a log file
In this task, I must navigate to the /home/analyst/logs directory and report on the error messages in the server_logs.txt file. Iâ€™ll do this by using grep to search the file and output only the entries that are for errors.

analyst@89b2f10a9b72:~$ cd logs
analyst@89b2f10a9b72:~/logs$ grep error server_logs.txt
2022-09-28 13:56:22 error   The password is incorrect
2022-09-28 15:56:22 error   The username is incorrect
2022-09-28 16:56:22 error   The password is incorrect
2022-09-29 13:56:22 error   An unexpected error occurred
2022-09-29 15:56:22 error   Unauthorized access
2022-09-29 16:56:22 error   Unauthorized access

Task 2. Find files containing specific strings
In this task, I must navigate to the /home/analyst/reports/users directory and use the correct Linux commands and arguments to search for user data files that contain a specific string in their names.

analyst@89b2f10a9b72:~/logs$ cd /home/analyst/reports/users
analyst@89b2f10a9b72:~/reports/users$ ls | grep Q1
Q1_access.txt
Q1_added_users.txt
Q1_deleted_users.txt
analyst@89b2f10a9b72:~/reports/users$ ls | grep access
Q1_access.txt
Q2_access.txt
Q3_access.txt
Q4_access.txt

Task 3. Search more file contents
In this task, I must search for information contained in user files and report on users that were added and deleted from the system.

analyst@89b2f10a9b72:~/logs$ cd /home/analyst/reports/users
analyst@89b2f10a9b72:~/reports/users$ ls | grep Q1
Q1_access.txt
Q1_added_users.txt
Q1_deleted_users.txt
analyst@89b2f10a9b72:~/reports/users$ ls | grep access
Q1_access.txt
Q2_access.txt
Q3_access.txt
Q4_access.txt
analyst@89b2f10a9b72:~/reports/users$ ls
Q1_access.txt       Q1_deleted_users.txt  Q2_added_users.txt    Q3_access.txt       Q3_deleted_users.txt  Q4_added_users.txt
Q1_added_users.txt  Q2_access.txt         Q2_deleted_users.txt  Q3_added_users.txt  Q4_access.txt         Q4_deleted_users.txt
analyst@89b2f10a9b72:~/reports/users$ grep jhill Q2_deleted_users.txt
1025         jhill     Sales
analyst@89b2f10a9b72:~/reports/users$ grep "Human Resources" Q4_added_users.txt
1151         sshah     Human Resources
1145         msosa     Human Resources
